Overview:
- This project explores digital image processing techniques with a focus on adding noise to images and applying filtering methods to remove it. The project utilizes the Fourier Transform, Notch filtering, and Band Reject filtering to analyze and clean up noisy images.
- 
Features:
1) Adding Periodic Noise: Introduces simulated periodic noise to grayscale images.
2) Fourier Transform Analysis: Uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze frequency components of images.
3) Notch Filtering: Implements frequency domain filtering to remove specific noise frequencies.
4) Band Reject Filtering: Applies a band reject filter to suppress unwanted frequency bands while preserving useful image details.
5) Visualization: Displays original, noisy, and filtered images using Matplotlib.
